SoundSeek started as a simple project where I was bridging the gap between the trending music in South Africa. The initial thought was a music app in the likes of iTunes, YouTube Music, Spotify, and so on. But as I was developing the site it ended up as a search platform that retrieves data from popular music platforms focusing on the Genre, artist, and year. It shows only the popular songs in terms of streams/views. It only shows the Top ten results be it the artist's songs or genre produced in that particular year.

Here it was showcasing my HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills.

The thing that I found to be difficult was using Java as it has more advanced features that require Node.js or React but I was able to produce this app and in the future, I think I will be able to produce more advanced sites.
